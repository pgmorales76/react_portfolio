# React Portfolio for Peter G. Morales

[Netlify App](https://pgmreactportfolio.netlify.app/)

## Feature #1: Clone Template and Deploy: As a user, I want to view a unique portfolio online, so that the skills and personality of the developer are portrayed

### Description

The first thing you'll want to do is spin up a fresh portfolio site from a template, and push it live! This will let you confirm all your updates are working in production as you go, letting you fix problems sooner rather than later.

Publish the unmodified template code to Netlify.

### Checklist

- Create a new portfolio using this CRA template: [Starter React Portfolio Template](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cra-template-react-portfolio). Follow the documentation to get started.

- You now have a new project, with a basic portfolio template in it. Fire it up, to test it locally. Don't worry about making any changes yet. If it's all looking good, make a new repo in your GitHub account, and push up this code.

- Deploy the fresh template to Netlify. Change the name of your site and the deployed URL to something professional and unique to you. Ensure that you are deploying a "production build" of your app (hint: `npm run build`... what does that do?).

- Update the README a little. Include at least the URL to your live, deployed site.

- Replace all instances (Edit > Find in Files) of "Ursula Lopez" with your name. Note that portfolio content is pulled from JSON source files in the `/public` folder. See how it works? Update just your name, then commit, push to GitHub, and publish your changes to Netlify to ensure your workflow is running smoothly.
