To keep the product selection process as untainted as possible, results aren't shown to users until there have been a total of 25 selections made.",

This is a game that is very begginer friendly and also challenging for those who want to test their memory skills! At the start of each round, 'Simon' picks a pattern of colors starting at one and adding a new color to the aforemention pattern each time the player completes the sequence. The speed at which each color is added is also incremented (the higher the level, the faster the speed). Each correct color grants the player a point and each point is tallied until the play picks the wrong color. At game over, the player inputs their name and their score is recorded. The top 10 highest scores are recorded for all players to compete against!",
